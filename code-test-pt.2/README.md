# The Perks Loyalty Supermarket

We've decided to branch out into the grocery business.
Though at the moment we only sell three products.

| Code | Name         | Price  |
| ---- | ------------ | ------ |
| CA6  | Cake         | £2.00  |
| A21  | Kitty Litter | £18.99 |
| G95  | Asparagus    | £0.83  |

## Your task

Contained within this repository is a React app with our current checkout solution.
Unfortunately it doesn't actually do very much as yet.
Your task is to extend this app with the following features.

### Features

1. Clicking on a product will add it to the order column.
2. Clicking a product multiple times will increase the quantity of that item in the order.
3. If the order total exceeds £10 a discount of 20% should be applied.
4. There should be buy-one-get-one-free on asparagus (because we're **that** generous).
5. The order column should display the total of the products less discounts.

## Running the project

The project uses create-react-app as a starter kit. To run it the steps should be:

1. ensure you have a recent version of node and yarn
2. `yarn`
3. `yarn start`

## Submitting your solution

Please send a zip archive containing your code (without the node_modules directory) to
webb at whitelabel-loyalty dot com.
